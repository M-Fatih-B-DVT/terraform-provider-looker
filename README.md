# terraform-provider-looker

Terraform provider for looker.com, built without dependencies on official go-sdk.

Autogenerated terraform docs available in [docs/index.md](docs/index.md)

## Important
Looker doesn't support concurrent operations on their database. That's why we are required to limit parallelism to <b>1</b> during the applying of changes.
Here is an example:
```
terraform apply -parallelism=1
```
Another way to do this -> environment variable:
```
export TF_CLI_ARGS_apply="-parallelism=1"
```
If parallelism is not limited, the Looker API will return 500 exceptions for heavy operations.
