If you're new to Terraform and want to get started creating infrastructure, please check out the Terraform official [Getting Started guides](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform#getting-started) on HashiCorp's learning platform. There are also [additional guides](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform#operations-and-development) to continue your learning.

## Developing the provider

To learn more about how to contribute to the development of this provider please refer to the [community guidelines](https://github.com/devoteamgcloud/terraform-provider-looker/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Build the provider locally

To build the provider locally, you need to execute following command at the root of the project.
```
make build
```
The provider will be under the /build/$VERSION folder. <br/>
Alternatively, you can manually execute the go build command as follows.
```
go build -o build/terraform-provider-looker
```
## Tips
Looker doesn't support concurrent operations on their database. That's why we are required to limit parallelism to <b>1</b> during the applying of changes.
Here is an example:
```
terraform apply -parallelism=1
```
If parallelism is not limited, the Looker API will return 500 exceptions for heavy operations.
