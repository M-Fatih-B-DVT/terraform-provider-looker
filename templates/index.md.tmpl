# Looker Provider

The Looker provider provides resources to interact with a Looker instance API.

To use the Looker provider, you will need API credentials. These can be generated at `https://org.cloud.looker.com/admin/users` and come in the form of "API3 Keys": <abbr title="\b[a-zA-Z0-9]{20}\b">`client_id`</abbr> and <abbr title="\b[a-zA-Z0-9]{24}\b">`client_secret`</abbr>.
Ensure the user used as owner of the API keys has sufficient admin permissions.
